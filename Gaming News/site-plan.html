      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Voidborn Gaming is a compact feature site designed to deliver thoughtful, clearly written game analysis. The site will publish two cornerstone features: a full review of <em>Battlefield 6</em> and a personal “Top 5 Games of All Time” list. The goal is to provide readers with context, criteria, and conclusions that help them decide what to play and why certain titles matter. The writing favors clarity over hype and aims to be welcoming to both long-time players and curious newcomers.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The intended audience is adults (18+) who enjoy games and value honest, readable critique. Some visitors will be deciding whether to buy or try <em>Battlefield 6</em>; others will come for perspective on older titles that still hold up. Readers are assumed to be familiar with general gaming terms, but the site avoids insider jargon where possible and explains references in plain language.

      <h3>Battlefield 6 Review</h3>
      <p>
        The <em>Battlefield 6</em> review evaluates the game across five criteria: core gunplay, map and mode design, team play and class identity, technical performance, and long-term support. It provides a launch-month assessment of how the game performs compared to its predecessors, noting improvements, balance, and player sentiment. The review highlights gameplay strengths such as refined recoil, better squad tools, and realistic map destruction, while also addressing performance concerns and live-service elements. The goal is to answer a clear question: “Is <em>Battlefield 6</em> worth your time right now?”

      <h3>My Top 5 Games of All Time</h3>
      <p>
        This feature presents a personal ranking with commentary on five influential titles:  
        <strong>1) Halo 2</strong> – a milestone in competitive multiplayer and console storytelling, setting standards for online connectivity and narrative scope.  
        <strong>2) Far Cry 5</strong> – a blend of open-world freedom and American frontier satire that balances chaotic gameplay with memorable characters and co-op design.  
        <strong>3) Elden Ring</strong> – a vast, interconnected world that rewards experimentation and persistence; its boss design and exploration redefine modern action RPGs.  
        <strong>4) Resident Evil 4 Remake</strong> – a masterclass in pacing and atmosphere, combining nostalgia with mechanical precision and visual polish for a new generation.  
        <strong>5) Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong> – a bold reinterpretation of a classic, merging emotional storytelling with cinematic presentation and layered combat systems.  
        Each entry explains what makes the game enduring and culturally significant while noting how these titles demonstrate the evolution of player agency, design philosophy, and emotional storytelling in interactive media. The article’s tone remains reflective and personal, inviting readers to compare their own formative experiences.
