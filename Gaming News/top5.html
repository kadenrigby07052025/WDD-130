      <h2>Top 5 Games of All Time</h2>
      <p>
        These are the games that have stuck with me long after the credits rolled. 
        They are not perfect, but each one blends gameplay, world building, and pure fun in a way that sets the bar for everything that comes after.

        <h3>1. Elden Ring</h3>
        <p>
          Elden Ring is my favorite combination of brutal combat and open exploration. 
          The Lands Between feel dangerous, mysterious, and rewarding at the same time, and discovering a new dungeon or boss never gets old. 
          The game respects the player enough to let them get lost, fail hard, and then come back stronger with a new build or strategy.

        <h3>2. Resident Evil 4 Remake</h3>
        <p>
          This remake keeps the campy charm of the original while tightening every system around it. 
          Combat is crisp, enemy variety is great, and the pacing swings between tension and action in a way that few games manage. 
          It is my go to recommendation for anyone who wants to try survival horror for the first time.

        <h3>3. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</h3>
        <p>
          Rebirth mixes nostalgia with modern design in a way that feels surprisingly fresh. 
          The combat system is fast and tactical, the characters are given more room to breathe, and the soundtrack is ridiculous in the best way. 
          Even if you never played the original, this is a standout role playing game.

        <h3>4. Far Cry 5</h3>
        <p>
          Far Cry 5 nails the feeling of a hostile open world where anything can go wrong in seconds. 
          The Montana setting is beautiful and unsettling, the cult storyline is memorable, and the co op chaos is endlessly entertaining. 
          It is one of the few sandboxes where I am happy to ignore the main quest and just explore.

        <h3>5. Halo 2</h3>
        <p>
          Halo 2 was my entry point to halo and defined my taste in gaming going forward. Though when i first played it i was too young to appreciate the story, i've replayed it several times
          since then. With each passing playthrough the themes of self discovery, brotherhood, and bravery have made greater impacts on me. The gameplay is smooth and fluid just like it was back 
          in 2004 and still very much satisfying. The story remains one of if not the best in the series and serves as a monument to gaming of the early 2000's. While it is considerably older than the others on this list,
            it still deserves a place on this list because of the impact it had and continues to have on me and for gameplay that stands the test of time...but it would be higher if it wasn't for the 
            infamous Legendary difficulty.
