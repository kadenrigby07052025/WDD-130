      <h2>Top 5 Games of All Time</h2>
      <p>
        These games did more than entertain me. They stuck with me, changed how I look at what games can be, 
        and left memories that feel like places I have actually been. 
        They are not just my favorites. They shaped who I am as a gamer.

        <h3>1. Elden Ring</h3>
        <p>
          There are games I finish and games I survive, and Elden Ring sits firmly in the second category.
          The Lands Between is not a place that guides you. It lets you drown, claw, rage, learn, and come back different.
          Every loss meant something because it was mine. Every victory felt earned rather than given.
          Elden Ring taught me patience, taught me stubbornness, and taught me that curiosity is a weapon.
          It is a world that never asks if you are ready. It waits, knowing eventually you will be.

        <h3>2. Resident Evil 4 Remake</h3>
        <p>
          This remake did not simply modernize a classic. It remembered what made it special.
          The tension, the pacing, the strange humor—it all remains,
          just sharpened into something more confident. 
          It is a game that turns every encounter into a memory. Every room feels like a story waiting to happen.
          It is rare for a remake to feel like the game you remember rather than the one that existed.
          This one does, and that is why it earns its place here.

        <h3>3. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</h3>
        <p>
          Rebirth feels like returning to a childhood home and finding it both familiar and impossibly new.
          It takes nostalgia, rewrites it, and still treats it with respect—and somehow it works.
          The characters breathe in ways the original never had room to. 
          The story is bold enough to challenge what fans expect instead of worshipping what came before.
          It is emotional when it needs to be, loud when it chooses to be, and quiet in ways that stick.
          It is not just a remake. It is a conversation with your memories.

        <h3>4. Far Cry 5</h3>
        <p>
          Far Cry 5 captured something I did not realize I loved—chaos as storytelling.
          Hope County is beautiful, hostile, unforgettable, and the danger never feels scripted.
          The world does not wait for the player. It erupts, interrupts, forces reactions, and 
          sometimes that chaos creates moments more memorable than any cutscene.
          It is a game that lets curiosity write the script, and for me that freedom was magic.
          I played it for the missions, but I stayed for the stories that only happened once.

        <h3>5. Halo 2</h3>
        <p>
          Halo 2 was my entry point to Halo, and it set the standard for everything I loved in games going forward.
          When I first played it, I was too young to appreciate the story, but every replay since has given me something new.
          The themes of brotherhood, sacrifice, identity, and courage hit harder now than they ever did then. 
          The gameplay still feels sharp, still feels fast, still feels like Halo. 
          Even today it stands tall—proof that some things age like steel rather than rust.
