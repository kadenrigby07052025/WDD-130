        <h2>Top Pick for 2025</h2>
        <h3>Battlefield 6 Review</h3>
        <p>
          Battlefield 6 feels like the series finally understands what it wants to be again. 
          Maps are large without being empty, objectives are clearly marked, and every match has at least one moment that feels like it belongs in a trailer. 
          The class system has been simplified, but there is still enough room for creative loadouts and squad roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gunplay is punchy and readable, explosions sound terrifying in the best way, and vehicles once again feel like match defining tools instead of background noise. 
          Performance is not perfect, and the launch still has the occasional bug, but in spite of that this is the multiplayer game I keep coming back to. 
          That constant pull to play one more round is exactly why it is my pick for best game of 2025.
