Welcome to the Only Gaming Site That Still Has a Soul
Tired of “critics” who hand out perfect scores like coupons at a gas station? Yeah, same. We don’t cozy up to publishers or swallow their PR lines — we gag on them, spit them out, and write what we actually think.

Forget the cookie-cutter “Top 5 Games” lists that feel like they were generated by an algorithm wearing a tie. Ours is hand-crafted by actual humans who’ve rage-quit more titles than most reviewers have played.

Our reviews are brutally honest, occasionally hungover, and proudly unsponsored. Expect opinions sharper than Dark Souls difficulty spikes and language spicy enough to get us demonetized twice before breakfast.

If you want truth with a side of profanity and zero corporate sugar-coating — grab a controller, friend. Let’s talk games like adults who still throw controllers.
